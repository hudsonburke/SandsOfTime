# Sands Of Time

## Project Description

### Overview

### Mechanical

### Electrical

### Software

## Things to remember
1. Fuses on everything
2. LEDs on power supply inputs
3. Ground on bottom by convention
4. Do everything in CAD first


## Future Work:
TODO: List problem and proposed solution
1. Better back mounting plate for motor and quadrature encoder 
2. Better fitting gear on quadrature shaft wobbles as it spins
3. Mount power supplies better
4. Consistent LED wiring
5. Better Dupont ribbon cables for encoders and LEDs ( Or heatshrink them)
6. Replace hour 5 encoder
7. Motor stall prevention: back off hourglass if supposed to be moving and no encoder change detected
